# Linux-installer-for-Star-Trek-Fleet-Command
This is a work in progress! Use at your own risk.

This is a project I did to install Star Trek Fleet Command on GNU/Linux systems without the need for Lutris or Steam.
The script will download the current wine version and STFC install program. Then it will create a wine 
prefix for the game with a name of your choice if you would like or just create an empty directory and select
that.If you type in a directory you will have to hit OK twice?
The program has an animated label to show when it is working. It does take a few minutes for the downloads
and the prefix creation.
Lastly we start the STFC install program. Just accept the default and follow the prompts. The install program will start the game to finish the installation.You should end up with an icon on your desktop to start the game.

The only problems I run into is closing the program, that normally results in killing the process. Thinking that may be a wine thing? STFC won't shutdown from Lutris either.  I find that most windows program perform just as well on Linux, just a bit more work to setup than Windows easy installers. This works on my Kubuntu 24 system, hope it works for you too.
